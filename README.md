DECO2017 Assignments 3 Web App Prototype
According to the user survey I did, I asked many users for their thoughts on immersive self-learning. When users enter the website, they can start learning with virtual characters. The learning website has six functional modules, Task, Stopwatch, Music, Overview, Pomodoro , Dictionary. Each function has a pop-up window to display its function, which will cause a problem that the user's screen is too crowded, so each function pop-up window can be dragged and zoomed to change the size or position of the window.
